# CollatzProgram
This program demonstrates the collatz conjecture in a program form.
The collatz Conjecture basically states that:
Any number, even or odd, exclusively, does not shoot to infinity if the following rule is applied:
Regarding an even number: divide i by 2
Regrading an odd number : divide multiply n by 3 and add 1.
Do this to the consecutive numbers and you will end up in a closed 4 2 1 loop.
This is also known as the 3x+1
